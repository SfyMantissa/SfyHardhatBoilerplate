# Sfy Hardhat Boilerplate ðŸš§

My personal boilerplate for Hardhat projects. 

## Notes

1. Every my project from now on will have a following layout:

   ```
   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts            <-- All deployed contract addresses are here
   â”œâ”€â”€ contracts            <-- All contracts (.sol) are here
   â”œâ”€â”€ deploy               <-- Deploy scripts
   â”œâ”€â”€ docs                 <-- Docs generated from NatSpec by hardhat-dodoc
   â”œâ”€â”€ hardhat.config.ts    <-- Hardhat config
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         <-- NPM-specific package config
   â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json    <-- NPM-specific package config (lock)
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            <-- Project's README
   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks                <-- All Hardhat tasks are here
   â”œâ”€â”€ test                 <-- All contract tests are here
   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json        <-- TypeScript config
   ```

2. There are helper functions for deployment and config updates in _deploy/utils_.

   Some ideas for future:

      - [ ] Put all constructor arguments in config.ts
      - [ ] Make config.ts a JSON-file and give it a more sensible name.
      - [ ] Add a flag for the deploy helper to NOT update the address in config.ts

3. I would also structure all my READMEs the same way as I do here:

   ```
   # Title Â                 <-- Main project title with a nice emoji.
   %Project explained in one line%
   
   ## Notes                 <-- General more detailed info, thoughts, etc.
   ...

   ## Usage                 <-- Sample deployment, usage, development, etc.
   ...

   ## Demo                  <-- Screenshots, GIFs, videos of the project's tests/usage
   ...
   ```
