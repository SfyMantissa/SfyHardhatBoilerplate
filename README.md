# Sfy Hardhat Boilerplate ðŸš§

My personal boilerplate for Hardhat projects.

## Notes

1. Some ideas for future:

   - [ ] Put all constructor arguments in config.ts
   - [ ] Make config.ts a JSON-file and give it a more sensible name.
   - [ ] Add a flag for the deploy helper to NOT update the address in config.ts
   - [ ] Add a script to automatically deploy the template.
   - [ ] Fill out the "Usage" and "Demo" blocks.

2. Every my project from now on will have a following layout:

   ```
   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts            <-- All deployed contract addresses are here
   â”œâ”€â”€ contracts            <-- All contracts (.sol) are here
   â”œâ”€â”€ deploy               <-- Deploy scripts
   â”œâ”€â”€ docs                 <-- Docs generated from NatSpec by hardhat-dodoc
   â”œâ”€â”€ hardhat.config.ts    <-- Hardhat config
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         <-- NPM-specific package config
   â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json    <-- NPM-specific package config (lock)
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            <-- Project's README
   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks                <-- All Hardhat tasks are here
   â”œâ”€â”€ test                 <-- All contract tests are here
   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json        <-- TypeScript config
   ```

3. There are helper functions for deployment and config updates in _deploy/utils_.

4. I would also structure all my READMEs the same way as I do here:

   ```
   # Title Â                 <-- Main project title with a nice emoji.
   ...

   ## Notes                 <-- General more detailed info, thoughts, etc.
   ...

   ## Usage                 <-- Sample deployment, usage, development, etc.
   ...

   ## Demo                  <-- Screenshots, GIFs, videos of the project's tests/usage
   ...
   ```
